# network-comparison

After undirected networks are constructed (construction.R), path lengths within each network are correlated with RT of target recall 
to select the best Baroni network (priming_paths.R, best Bar model: bar_50.rds). Quantum model of word activation based on the respective network structure
is also correlated with RT of target recall (quantum.R)

Raw data also includes the semantic space baroni.rda, which can be downloaded from https://sites.google.com/site/fritzgntr/software-resources/semantic_spaces
